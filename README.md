# PC Component Store ðŸ›’
This is an online store for the sale of PC components. The goal of this project was to improve my skills in Strapi.

Features
Designed the entire user interface based on the data loaded in the Strapi backend.
Implemented filters, searches, and sortings using Strapi's database to simplify the experience.
Utilized Node FS package to create and write to a JSON file for backup data storage.
Used technologies such as React, Redux-toolkit, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Strapi, Express, Railway, and Redux-persist to improve performance and caching.
Payment
WhatsApp is used as the method of payment to simplify the experience and establish better contact with the customers.

Usage
All products are displayed using data from the JSON file, which is updated upon any POST, PUT, or DELETE operations. This ensures that only the data from the JSON file is used for all features including adding to favorites and cart.
